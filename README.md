# TIC-TAC-TOE (REACT)

## Project Description

> This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game, Single Page Web Application(SPA) built using `React JS` and `Vite`.

> It was built as a second part in a journey series leading upto the creation of an online version of the game that can be played between 2 players/users over the internet.

> It was built to test out and have the feel of rendering the game on a webpage before moving on to creating its multiplayer version, and it follows a `Tic-Tac-Toe` game that was built to be rendered in a `terminal/console` which can be found [here](https://google.com)
